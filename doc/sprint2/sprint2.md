### Team capacity recorded:

### Decisions about user stories: 
  - Our priority for the users to be able to create accounts or another account with same email to watch different genres won't be necessary as users can access to watch trailers and look at reviews without creating an account.
  - users to have access to their history on movie trailers and reviews where they can edit or delete
  - users to have access to notifications for any likes, reviews, or any upcoming new movie trailers
