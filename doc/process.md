Overall, the team members worked really well together. We all knew each other's strengths, which made it easier for us to divide the work and get it done at a faster pace.
Some tools used to organize the team were Discord for regular meetings and Google Docs along with Git Hub for shared collaboration and brainstorming. 
During daily meetings, all the group members offered their suggestions on how to implement certain aspects of the project and a unanimous decision was reached based on everyone's approval.
The most important tasks were given high priority which needs to be implemented first, for the user stories around 3 rounds of voting were conducted for the whole team to come to a consensus for the point estimate.
We made sure to meet daily for about 20-30 minutes to discuss what has been done so far and what needs to be done moving forward.
Some lessons we can improve going forward into the next phase are the daily meetings we had for sprint 0 and finishing assigned tasks before the deadline which gives us time to look over what each member has done and if it aligns with the requirements of the project.
