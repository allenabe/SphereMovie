Frontend: We'll structure the templates for HTML and parts of JavaScript that implement the interactive frontend for SphereMovie. We will create HTML templates to render major sections: the homepage, movie collection, trailer viewing capability, and review submission. We will also make use of a templating engine in rendering our content dynamically. Event listeners in JavaScript will manage the users actions with the application, such as button clicks and form submissions. It will make asynchronous requests, known as AJAX, to prevent page reloads. Initial CSS styling includes a very basic clean layout to establish a foundation that is easy to build upon in the future sprints for an enhanced user experience.

Backend: We will implement methods on the back-end, what we refer to as "controllers." They are what control the actions that users interact with when navigating to a website, including creating an account, signing in, viewing movies and posting comments. These controllers act as a liaison between what users see (the frontend) and what actually stores the data, the database. We will then route-in other words, give pathways for specific actions-say, /login, /signup, and /movies-forward each request to its relevant controller function. This cleans up our back-end and makes maintenance far easier. All these will be efficiently supported on the basis of a server like Express.js by taking the user request and their corresponding responses in the fastest and most reliable way.
